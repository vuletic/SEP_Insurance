# SEP Insurance
The main goal of this application is to allow customers to purchase insurance online. The second important feature enables customers to quickly check insurance price.

For calculating insurance prices the application uses a rule engine.

The application's payment system is connected to [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/about). When a customer wants to pay his insurance policy he gets redirected to PayPal's site, where he can safely finish the purchase.

In the end the customer receives an e-mail from the application, describing the outcome of it's purchase.
